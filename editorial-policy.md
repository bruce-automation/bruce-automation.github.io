  <h1 class="h1">Editorial policy</h1>
  <div class="prose">
    <h2>Quality & accuracy</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No fabricated citations.</li>
      <li>Factual claims should be backed by primary sources (official docs, pricing pages, reputable technical references).</li>
      <li>Opinions are labeled as opinions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Affiliate / sponsorship</h2>
    <p>If an article contains affiliate links, a short disclosure appears near the first affiliate link. Sponsored content (if any) is clearly labeled and does not override editorial independence.</p>

    <h2>Sensitive topics</h2>
    <p>The site avoids medical / legal / financial advice. When a topic is adjacent to a sensitive area, it is treated conservatively and with sources.</p>
